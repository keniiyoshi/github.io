## Welcome to Ken Iiyoshi's GitHub Page!

This page is a collection of projects for showcasing my web development skills. It complements [keniiyoshi.com](https://www.keniiyoshi.com), which is my full portfolio.

The page currently holds two projects: my excercises on jQuery based on a [LinkedIn Course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/jquery-essential-training-2?u=2131553), and my interactive storytelling course from 2018 NYUAD J-Term in Shanghai. 


```## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/keniiyoshi/github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
`Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

```For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/keniiyoshi/github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
