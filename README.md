## Welcome to Ken Iiyoshi's GitHub Page!

This page is a collection of projects for showcasing my web development skills. It complements [keniiyoshi.com](https://www.keniiyoshi.com), which is my full portfolio.

The page currently holds two projects: my excercises on jQuery based on a [LinkedIn Course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/jquery-essential-training-2?u=2131553), and my final project from [Explorable Stories, NYUAD's 2018 Shanghai J-Term course](https://github.com/craigprotzel/explorablestories).
