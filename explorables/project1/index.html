					<h3>About</h3>
					<div id="about"> The goal of this project is to teach busy NYUAD students the names of major sites (Waitan, Nanjing Lu, Yuyuan, Xintiandi, Tianzifang) in Hunagpu district of Shanghai in just 5 to 10 minutes in order for them to maximize their experience at the city for J-term or a semester study-abroad. The user will have the option to explore five locations as Luke Skywalker accompanied by Jedi master Yoda. Their dialogues are based on scenes from Star Wars: The Empire Strikes back, and will help the user memorize the site names. Ideally, the desin of the website will be star-wars themed, with a customized Google map of Huangpu that covers the entire screen, but as of now, the layout is makeshift group of Google map, buttons, images, and dialogues. The most challenging part of this project was not actually the technical issues behind programming (which was nonetheless formidable), but was the process of crafting a dynamic story that leads up to a meaningful point of reflection. This project will be carried on to project 2, where I aim to incorporate more visuals (video, GIFs), audios(sounds that represents the sites or aids mnemonic devices) and stories (ideally customizable based on the order of site visit) that have interactivity. I should also study the scenes from Star Wars more to make Star Wars-cultured users to be able to relate to parodies in my story more easily, perhaps sample sounds and videos from there as well (i.e. have some texts in the website in the star wars intro format).</div>
