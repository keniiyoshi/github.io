					      <h1>HUANGPU AWAKENS</h1>
						    </div>
						    <p>It is a period of study abroad. Luke Skywalker, escaping from Saadiyat Island, has won his NYUSH study away.</p>     
						    <p>During the escape, Obi Wan Kenobi instructs Luke to train under the retired Jedi master, Yoda, who possesses the memory skills necessary to remember important location names in Shanghai.</p>
						    <p>Pursued by the boredom of packing, Luke races to Huangpu aboard his X-Wing, the central district in Shanghai where Yoda resides in.</p>

Easily they flow, quick to join you in procrastination. A true Jedi uses the Force for community serving and self empowerment. Now, a challenge for you ... lift the X-ring using your force and bring it here.</div>

						<!-- The 16 different results: -->
						<div id="INTJ" class="end">Yoda: Imaginative and strategic thinker, you are, with a plan for everything. Take care, you must still. It is often  a challenge for you to find like-minded individuals given your relentless intellectual approach to global learning. To sustain the intensity of your learning, I encourage you to have good friends who can support you.</div>

						<div id="INTP" class="end">Yoda: Innovative inventor, you are, with an unquenchable thirtst for knowledge. Take care, you must still. You have a tendency to share your thoughts to others before thinking it through.</div>

						<div id="ENTJ" class="end">Yoda: Bold, imaginative, and strong-willed, you are, always finding or making a way to learn things efficiently. Take care, you must still. You can be at times insensitively call out others' failures, bringing yourself into trouble.</div>

						<div id="ENTP" class="end">Yoda: Smart and curious thinker, you are. Always ready for an intellectual challenge. Take care, you must still. You tend to focus on comping up with ideas rather than implementing them on a daily basis. When in doubt, ust go out in the city and immerse yourself with the language in cultural learning.</div>

						<div id="INFJ" class="end">Yoda: QUiet and mystical, you are, yet very inspiring and tireless idealist. Take care, you must still. Your passion is perfectly capable of carrying you past your breaking point and if your zeal gets out of hand, you can find yourself exhausted, unhealthy and stressed. It will help to have a  good friend who can keep in touch with you.</div>

						<div id="INFP" class="end">Yoda: Poetic, kind and altruistic, you are, always eager to help a good cause. Take care, you must still. You carry a high risk of feeling misunderstood. When in doubt, trust yourself and keep moving forward.</div>

						<div id="ENFJ" class="end">Yoda: Charismatic and inspiring, you are, able to mesmerize your listeners. Take care, you must still. Altough you have a tremendous capacity for reflecting on and analyzing your own feelings, if you get too caught up in another person’s plight, you can become very anxious, seeing other people’s problems in yourself, trying to fix something in yourself that is not wrong.</div>

						<div id="ENFP" class="end">Yoda: Enthusiastic, creative and sociable free spirit, you are, who can always find a reason to smile. Take care, you must still. If you rely too much on your intuition, assume or anticipate too much about a friend’s motivations, you can misread the signals and frustrate study plans that a more straightforward approach would have made simple.</div>

						<div id="ISTJ" class="end">Yoda: Practical and fact-minded, you are, with undeniable reliability. Take care, you must still. You have little tolerance for indecisiveness, and lose patience even more quickly if your chosen course is challenged with impractical theories, especially if they ignore key details – if challenges becomes time-consuming debates, you can become noticeably angry as deadlines tick nearer.</div>
						<div id="ISFJ" class="end">Yoda: Very dedicated and warm, you are, always ready to defend your loved ones. Take care, you must still. You need to know when to say no and stand up for yourself if you are to maintain your confidence and enthusiasm.</div>
						<div id="ESTJ" class="end">Yoda: Extraordinarily caring, social and popular, you are, always eager to help. However, do be careful. You need to recognize that not everyone follows the same path or contributes in the same way.</div>

						<div id="ESFJ" class="end">Yoda: Excellent at administrative tasks, you are, unsurpassed at managing things – or people. Take care, you must still. You should keep in mind that people come from many backgrounds and perspectives, and what may seem right to them is not always an absolute truth.</div>

						<div id="ISTP" class="end">Yoda: Bold and practical, you are, showing mastery with many kinds of tools. Take care, you must still. You often act too soon, taking for granted your permissive nature and assuming that others are the same. Take a breath from time to time to reflect on your global experience</div>

						<div id="ISFP" class="end">Yoda: Flexible and charming, you are, always ready to explore and experience something new. Take care, you must still. You find planning for the future to be quite challenging, as you plan actions and behaviors as contributions to a sense of identity, building a portfolio of experiences, not stocks.</div>

						<div id="ESTP" class="end">Yoda: Smart, energetic and very perceptive, you are. Living on the edge is a great enjoyment for you. Take care, you must still. You may get too caught in the moment, take things too far, and run roughshod over more sensitive people, or forget to take care of your own health and safety.</div>

						<div id="ESFP" class="end">Yoda: Spontaneous, energetic and enthusiastic entertainer, you are. Life is always exciting around you. Take care, you must still. You are often so focused on immediate pleasures that you neglect the learning and deadlines that make those luxuries possible.</div>

						<!-- dialogue continued -->
						<div id="you">You: Ok, I will work on it.</div>
						<div id="yoda">Yoda: Pass on what you have learned. You, you behind the screen. Visit the places, you must. Become more united with the force of Huangpu! Even if you do not manage to, fine it will be. Conversant about recommending your friends where to visit in Shanghai, you will be. Sharing to your NYUAD friends, destiny, it will be...</div>

				<h3>About</h3>
				<p id="about"> The goal of this project is to teach a busy NYUAD students the names of major locations in the Huangpu district of Shanghai in just 5 minutes to aid their experience at the city for J-term or a semester abroad, as well as advising what learning approach best fits their personality. For Star Wars novices, this project will hopefully stir interest in the series and for Star Wars fans, the story will serve as another way to enjoy the saga. The user will have the option to go through five locations as Luke Skywalker, accompanied by the Jedi master Yoda and occasionally Master Obi Wan Kenobi. Yoda, depending on how the user respond to each of the location, will give you a customized advice on your cultural learning strategies at NYUSH.</p>
				<p id="about"> The project is around 800 lines long in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes. Please feel free to reuse the code! The story dialogues were based on scenes from Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and the Return of Jedi. The Star Wars theme was adopted for this project as using well-known characters were necessary for a story so short. The main dialogues and the ending font was in Franklin Gothic Medium Cond font, while the opening font was in Pathway Gothic One. The decision buttons control logic variables which allows 16 different user-customized ending to be shown in the end. The fonts used in the project was also based on the actual star wars movies. The most challenging part of this project was not the technical issues behind programming, but was actually the process of crafting a dynamic story that ended with a meaningful point of reflection, as well as formulating effective puns. For future improvement, each scene will have better visuals including videos and sound effects. More importantly, the interactivity of the story will be enhanced by actually having the decision buttons influence the development of the story. In the name of gender equality, I probably should have made an option for female users to be able to play as a female character. This will involve creating a whole new plot, perhaps modeled after story lines of Leia Organa or Rey from the newest trilogy.</p>
